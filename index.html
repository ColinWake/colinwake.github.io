                <h1>My Upbringing</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Colin Wakefield. I was born and raised just north of Columbus, Ohio, and that of course
                    means I’m a <strong><em>huge</em></strong>
                    Buckeye fan. I played sports throughout my childhood and teens and still enjoy watching a variety of
                    them today. <br><br> My
                    fascination with computers started at a young age, when my older brother let me play StarCraft for
                    the first time. This
                    eventually led to me wanting to learn how to create my own applications, and that’s where my love
                    for coding began.<br><br>I
                    enrolled in the Spring ‘20 cohort at WeCanCodeIT coding bootcamp to achieve my aspiration of
                    becoming a
                    software engineer. I
                    enjoy finding different solutions to problems and encouraging different ways of thinking to my
                    peers, and I think it’s
                    important to be open to accepting differing solutions.
                </p>
                <h1>My Experiences</h1>
                <p>
                    I began learning Java at the ripe young age of 15, throwing myself into the deep end with no idea
                    what I was doing. It was a long journey filled with hours of browsing StackOverflow and attempting
                    to figure out why I had a <code>NullPointerException</code>.<br><br>Since then, I grew fascinated
                    with
                    the power of different languages and I wanted to make sure I
                    knew at least the basic syntax of many languages, because what would be a 50 line solution in one
                    language could be
                    a 5 line solution with better performance in another. I couldn't be happier with my journey so far,
                    and I'm constantly striving to learn new technologies and leverage that knowledge to help create a
                    more efficient piece of software.
                    <br><br>Along with Java, I've worked with <a target="_blank" href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>, C# &
                    VB.NET,
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, Python, C/C++,
                    JavaScript
                    and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> using Node.js, and
                    HTML5 with CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid).
