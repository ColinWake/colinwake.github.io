                <h1>My Upbringing</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Colin Wakefield. I was born and raised just north of Columbus, Ohio, and that of course
                    means I’m a <strong><em>huge</em></strong>
                    Buckeye fan. I played sports throughout my childhood and teens and still enjoy watching a variety of
                    them today. <br><br> My
                    fascination with computers started at a young age, when my older brother let me play StarCraft for
                    the first time. This
                    eventually led to me wanting to learn how to create my own applications, and that’s where my love
                    for coding began.<br><br>I
                    enrolled in the Spring ‘20 cohort at WeCanCodeIT bootcamp to achieve my aspiration of becoming a
                    software developer. I
                    enjoy finding different solutions to problems and encouraging different ways of thinking to my
                    peers, and I think it’s
                    good to be open to different solutions than the one you may have had in mind.
                </p>
                <h1>My Experiences</h1>
                <p>
                    I began learning Java at the ripe young age of 15, throwing myself into the deep end with no idea
                    what I was doing. It was a long journey filled with hours of browsing StackOverflow and attempting
                    to figure out why I had a <code>NullPointerException</code>, but everything was worth it in the end.
                    <br><br>Along with Java, I've worked with <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a>, C#, Python, C/C++,
                    JavaScript
                    and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> using Node.js, and HTML5 with CSS3.
